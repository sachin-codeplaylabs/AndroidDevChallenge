### Tell us what your idea is. 

 Vani allows you to handle your daily incoming calls using voice commands.
 üìû Say 'Hello' to Accept Calls.
 ‚òé Say 'No' to Decline Calls.
 üéôÔ∏è Say 'Speaker' to answer the call on Speaker Mode.
 ü§≥ Say 'SMS' to send an auto-reply message.
 You can also customize your own words.
 Like - Hello, Sorry, Good Bye, Shut up, Hola etc.
Answer incoming calls without touching the screen while your hands are busy or driving in your car.


### Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
##### End Users - Differently abled, Car Drivers and Teens

Imagine, how difficult it is for Differently abled people to use smartphones especially incoming and outgoing calls, which is the mother feature of every smartphone. The Differently abled people use TTS Tech. and takes 4-5 swipes to answer the phone correctly. (Time Consumption ‚Äì 15-20 seconds + big irritation).
We have developed an app name - Vani - Your Personal Voice Assistant Call Answer

Where user can answer the calls with just a command. Just say ‚Äúhello‚Äù and your call will be answered. Say ‚ÄúSpeaker‚Äù to answer the call in speaker mode.
We want to train end user‚Äôs voice on smartphone itself to get higher accuracy for specific users, which will be language independent.
We want Google Help in Speech Recognizer and noise cancellation, so each and every user can have easy access over the incoming calls with no language barrier.

##### Later, we want to integrate the app with Google Assistant or Android Auto.


### Tell us about you. 
 
 We (Sparsh Agrawal, Sachin Gupta and Jatin Babbar) are 3 founders, working in this project from last 3 years. Earlier, we use to provide IT services and tech. consultants to lot of Startups and Companies.
We want to make this tech. so robust, so that in future we can eliminate the process of swiping the incoming calls not just for Differently abled but for everyone. Like ‚Äì pin/password phone unlock is totally replaced by Fingerprint lock.
The idea here is with speaker recognition, noise cancellation and hot word detection, we can remove swipes and bring voice ‚ò∫ which will be robust, secure and user friendly.
We are 70% robust as of now, with Google Tech. help, we want to achieve higher rates of accuracy. Also, with no marketing - We have achieved 2 million downloads globally.
So, definitely there is a need of this product.
